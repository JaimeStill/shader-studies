# GLSL Renderer

This project was put together thanks to the **In Three.js** section of [The Book of Shaders: Running Your Shader](https://thebookofshaders.com/04) as well as the **Option 1: Install with NPM and a build tool** section of [three.js docs - Installation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation).

To run:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
2. Open a terminal and change directory to `renderer`.
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start.
5. Change the shader loaded in [main.js](./main.js#L3) to adjust the running shader.
