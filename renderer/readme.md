# GLSL Renderer

This project was put together thanks to the **In Three.js** section of [The Book of Shaders: Running Your Shader](https://thebookofshaders.com/04) as well as the **Option 1: Install with NPM and a build tool** section of [three.js docs - Installation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation).
