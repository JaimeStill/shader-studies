# Shader Types

> There is no official file format for OpenGL shaders. You can give every file a `.glsl` extension and it will work just fine. However, [glslang](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/), Khronos' reference GLSL compiler / validator, uses extensions to determine what type of shader that the file is for. These values are provided in the table below.

Name | Extension | Description
-----|-----------|------------
Vertex Shader | `.vert` | Used to add special effects to objects in a 3D envirnoment by performing mathematical operations on the objects' vertex data.
Tessellation Control Shader | `.tesc` | Controls how much tessellation a particular patch gets.
Tessellation Evaluation Shader | `.tese` | Computes the interpolated positions and other per-vertex data from the results of a Tessellation operation.
Geometry Shader | `.geom` | Governs the processing of Primitives.
Fragment Shader | `.frag` |  Processes a Fragment generated by the Rasterization into a set of colors and a single depth value.
Compute Shader | `.comp` | General purpose shaders used entirely for computing arbitrary information.
